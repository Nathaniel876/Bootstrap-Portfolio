                <p>Hello My name is Nathaniel Taylor and I am an eager and motivated individual who is willing to learn
                    and gain experience with each and every opportunity given to me. I recently relocated from Jamaica
                    in hopes of achieving my dream job as a web developer and would be grateful for a chance to enhance
                    my knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>The reason why technology is important to me is because it is so vast and innovative and is always
                    improving. There is so many things that technology can solve, such as helping people connect from
                    all over the world. Having an education and experience from a company and University in the United
                    States will help me in many ways so I am able to give back to people in my country.
                </p>
                <p>I have experience with web development languages such as HTML , CSS, JavaScript, Express, Sequelize
                    ,MySql and Passport.js and Node.js i am also willing to learn additional languages to gain
                    experience. </p>
